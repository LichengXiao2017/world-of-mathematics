Interest in the subject increased during the 19th and 20th century, together with the development of <a href="Graph_Theory">graph theory</a> and problems like the four colour theorem. Some of the leading mathematicians include Blaise Pascal (1623 &#8211; 1662), Jacob Bernoulli (1654 &#8211; 1705) and Leonhard Euler (1707 &#8211; 1783).</p><p>Combinatorics has many applications in other areas of mathematics, including <a href="Graph_Theory">Graph Theory</a>, <a href="Coding_and_Cryptography">Coding and Cryptography</a>, and <a href="Probability">Probability</a>.</p><h2>Factorials</h2><p>Combinatorics can help us count the number of <em>orders</em> in which something can happen. Consider the following example:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a classroom there are <i data-var="CombA1|3|slider|2,5,1">V.CombA1</i> pupils and <i>V.CombA1</i> chairs standing in a row. In how many different orders can the pupils sit on these chairs?</em></p></blockquote><p>Let us list the possibilities &#8211; in this example the <i>V.CombA1</i> different pupils are represented by <i>V.CombA1</i> different colours of the chairs.</p><p class="centre"><i data-function="$('#factorials0').attr('src','resources/Combinatorics/'+V.CombA1+'P'+V.CombA1+browser.imgExt+'.png').attr('width',V.CombA1==1?29:V.CombA1==2?156:V.CombA1==3?336:586)"><img id="factorials0" src="resources/Combinatorics/3P3.png"></i></p><p>There are <i>switch(V.CombA1) { case 2: 2; break; case 3: 6; break; case 4: 24; break; case 5: 120; break; }</i> different possible orders. Notice that the number of possible orders increases very quickly as the number of pupils increases. With 6 pupils there are 720 different possibilities and it becomes impractical to list all of them. Instead we want a simple formula that tells us how many orders there are for <em>n</em> people to sit on <em>n</em> chairs. <span class="lgrey">Then we can simply substitute 3, 4 or any other number for <em>n</em> to get the right answer.</span></p><p>Suppose we have <i data-var="CombB1|4|slider|1,7,1">V.CombB1</i> chairs and we want to place <i>V.CombB1==1?'one pupil':V.CombB1==2?'two pupils':V.CombB1==3?'three pupils':V.CombB1==4?'four pupils':V.CombB1==5?'five pupils':V.CombB1==6?'six pupils':'seven pupils'</i> on them. <i>switch(V.CombB1) { case 7: 'There are 7 pupils who could sit on the first chair.

To simplify notation, mathematicians use a &#8220;!&#8221; called factorial.

Again we should think about generalising this. We start like we would with factorials, but we stop before we reach 1. In fact we stop as soon as we reach the number students without chair.

However in some problems you don&#8217;t care about the order and just want to know how many ways there are to select a certain number of objects from a bigger set.</p><blockquote><p><em>In a shop there are five different T-shirts you like, coloured red, blue, green, yellow and black. Unfortunately you only have enough money to buy three of them. How many ways are there to select three T-shirts from the five you like?</em></p></blockquote><p>Here we don&#8217;t care about the order (it doesn&#8217;t matter if we buy black first and then red or red first and then black), only about the number of <strong>combinations</strong> of T-shirts. The possibilities are</p><p class="centre"><img src="resources/Combinatorics/comb1.png" width="702" height="194" alt="10 combinations"></p><p>so there are 10 in total. If we had calculated 5<strong>P</strong>3 = 60, we would have double-counted some possibilities, as the following table shows:</p><p class="centre"><img src="resources/Combinatorics/comb2.png" width="759" height="208" alt="10 combinations" style="margin: 5px 0 5px 0"></p><p>With permutations, we count every combination of three T-shirts 6 times, because there are 3! = 6 ways to order the three T-shirts.

However we are also allowed to take more than one fruit of each kind, for example two apples, one strawberry and one banana.</p><p>We can represent any valid selection of fruit by a string of stars and bars, as shown in this example:</p><table width="360" border="0" class="tableSmall"><tr><td>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</td><td>|</td><td>&#9733;&#9733;</td><td>|</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>|</td><td>&#9733;&#9733;</td><td>|</td><td>&#9733;</td></tr><tr class="caption"><td>3 of type 1</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2 of type 2</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>0 of type 3</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2 of type 4</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1 of type 5</td></tr></table><p>In total there are <em>r</em> stars (representing the <em>r</em> fruit we are allowed to take) and there are <em>n</em> &#8211; 1 bars (dividing the <em>n</em> different kinds of fruit). This makes <em>r</em> + <em>n</em> &#8211; 1 places in total. Any ordering of <em>r</em> stars and <em>n</em> &#8211; 1 bars corresponds to precisely one valid selection of fruit.</p><p>Now we can apply our combinatorial tools: there are <em>r</em> + <em>n</em> &#8211; 1 places and we want to choose <em>n</em> &#8211; 1 of them to be bars (all the others are stars). That there are exactly (<em>r</em> + <em>n</em> &#8211; 1)<strong>C</strong>(<em>n</em> &#8211; 1) possibilities to do that!</p></div></div><div class="boxWrap"><div class="boxTextWrap"><p>Suppose there are five kinds of fruit and we want to take ten items.

You often want to find the probability of one particular event and you can use the equation</p><p class="centre"><em>P</em>(<em>X</em>) &nbsp;=&nbsp; probability that <em>X</em> happens &nbsp;=&nbsp; <span class="frac"><span class="frac-top">number of outcomes where <em>X</em> happens</span><span class="frac-bot">total number of possible outcomes</span></span></p><p>You can use combinatorics to calculate the &#8220;total number of possible outcomes&#8221;. Here is an example:</p><blockquote><p><em>Four children, called A, B, C and D, sit randomly on four chairs. What is the probability that A sits on the first chair?</em></p></blockquote><p>We have already shown that in total there are 24 ways to sit on four chairs. If you look back at our solution, you will also find that A sits on the first chair in six of the cases. Therefore</p><p class="centre"><em>P</em>(A sits on the first chair) &nbsp;=&nbsp; <span class="frac"><span class="frac-top">number of outcomes where A sits on the first chair</span><span class="frac-bot">total number of possible outcomes</span></span> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <span class="frac"><span class="frac-top">6</span><span class="frac-bot">24</span></span> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <span class="frac"><span class="frac-top">1</span><span class="frac-bot">4</span></span>.</p><p>This answer was expected, since each of the four children is equally likely to sit on the first chair. But other cases are not quite as straightforward&#8230;</p><div class="box frame tabbed"><div class="boxTabBar boxTabBar50"><div class="boxTabLink on">Exercises</div><div class="boxTabLink">Solutions</div></div><div class="boxWrap on"><div class="boxTextWrap"><div class="rbox" style="margin-bottom:0"><img src="resources/Combinatorics/lotto.jpg" width="320" height="200" alt="Lotto Balls"></div><p>(a) A postman has to deliver four letters to four different houses in a street. Unfortunately the rain has erased the addresses, so he just distributes them randomly, one letter per house. What is the probability that every house gets the right letter? <span class="dgrey">(&#9734; What is the probability that every house gets a wrong letter?)</span></p><p>(b) In a lottery you have to guess 6 out of 49 numbers. What is the probability that you get all of them right? If submit 100 guesses every week, how long on average will it take you to win?</p><div class="clear"></div></div></div><div class="boxWrap"><div class="boxTextWrap"><p>(a) There are 4! = 24 ways to randomly distribute the letters, and only one way to get all of them right. Thus the probability that every letter is delivered to the right house is 1 / 24 = 0.0417 = 4.17%.</p><p class="dgrey">To find the probability that every letter gets delivered to the wrong house is a bit more difficult. It is not simply 1 &#8211; 0.0417, since there are many cases in which one or two, but not <em>all</em> houses get the right letter. In this simple case, the easiest solution would be to write down all 24 possibilities. You will find that in 9 out of the 24 cases every house gets a wrong letter, which gives a probability of 0.375 = 37.5%. If there more too many houses to write down all possibilities, you can use an idea called the <strong>Inclusion Exclusion principle</strong>.</p><p>(b) There are 49<strong>C</strong>6 = 10,068,347,520 possible outcomes of the lottery, so the probability of getting the right solution is 1 / 49<strong>C</strong>6 = 0.0000000001.</p><p>On average it will also take 10,068,347,520 attempts to win. If we submit 100 guesses every week this corresponds to 100,683,475 week, which is the same as 1,936,200 years.
