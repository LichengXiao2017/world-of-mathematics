This divides the circle into many different regions, and we can count the number of regions in each case. The diagrams below show how many regions there are for several different numbers of points on the circumference. <span class="lgrey">We have to make sure that only two lines meet at every intersection inside the circle, not three or more.</span></p><table width="95%" border="0" class="tableFixed tableSmall"><tr><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle1.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle1"></td><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle2.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle2"></td><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle3.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle3"></td><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle4.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle4"></td><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle5.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle5"></td></tr><tr><td class="caption">1 region</td><td class="caption">2 regions</td><td class="caption">4 regions</td><td class="caption">8 regions</td><td class="caption">16 regions</td></tr></table><p>We can immediately see a pattern: the number of regions is always twice the previous one, so that we get the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &hellip; This means that with 6 points on the circumference there would be 32 regions, and with 7 points there would be 64 regions.</p><p>We might decide that we are happy with this result. The number of regions is always twice the previous one &#8211; after all this worked for the first five cases. Or we might decide that we should check a few more, just to be safe:</p><table width="95%" border="0" class="tableFixed tableSmall" style="width: 280px"><tr><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle6.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle6"></td><td><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/circle7.png" width="94" height="98" alt="circle7"></td></tr><tr><td class="caption">31 regions, not 32</td><td class="caption">57 regions, not 64</td></tr></table><p>Unfortunately something went wrong: 31 might look like a counting mistake, but 57 is much less than 64. The sequence continues 99, 163, 256, &#8230;, very different from what we would get when doubling the previous number.</p><p>This example illustrates why, in mathematics, you can&rsquo;t just say that an observation is <em>always true</em> just because it works in a few cases you have tested. Instead you have to come up with a rigorous logical argument that leads from results you already know, to something new which you want to show to be true. Such an argument is called a <strong>proof</strong>.</p><p>Proofs are what make mathematics different from all other sciences, because once we have proven something we are <em>absolutely certain</em> that it is and will <em>always</em> be true. It is not just a theory that fits our observations and may be replaced by a better theory in the future.</p><p>In the above example, we could count the number of intersections in the inside of the circle. Thinking carefully about the relationship between the number of intersections, lines and regions will eventually lead us to a different equation for the number of regions when there are <em>x</em> = <i data-var="Axi|3|slider|1,50,1">V.Axi</i> points on the circle:</p><p class="center">Number of regions &nbsp;=&nbsp; <span class="frac"><span class="frac-top"><em>x</em><sup>4</sup> &#8211; 6 <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 23 <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> &#8211; 18 <em>x</em> + 24</span><span class="frac-bot">24</span></span> &nbsp;=&nbsp; <i>(Math.pow(V.Axi,4) - 6*Math.pow(V.Axi,3) + 23*Math.pow(V.Axi,2) - 18*V.Axi + 24)/24</i>.</p><p>This equation works in all the cases above. We could now try to prove it for <em>every</em> value of <em>x</em> using &#8220;induction&#8221;, a technique explained below.</p><p>Traditionally, the end of a proof is indicated using a &#9632; or &#9633;, or by writing <em>QED</em> or <em>&#8220;quod erat demonstrandum&#8221;</em>, which is Latin for <em>&#8220;what had to be shown&#8221;</em>.</p><p>A result or observation that <em>we think</em> is true is called a <strong>Hypothesis</strong> or <strong>Conjecture</strong>. Once we have proven it, we call it a <strong>Theorem</strong>. Once we have proven a theorem, we can use it to prove other, more complicated results &#8211; thus building up a growing network of mathematical theorems.</p><h2>Axioms</h2><div class="rbox"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/athens.jpg" width="320" height="203" class="shadow"/><p class="caption">Raphael&rsquo;s <em>School of Athens</em>: the ancient Greek mathematicians were the first to approach mathematics using a logical and axiomatic framework.</p></div><p>One interesting question is where to start from. How do you prove the first theorem, if you don&rsquo;t know anything yet? Unfortunately you can&#8217;t prove something using nothing. You need at least a few building blocks to start with, and these are called <strong>Axioms</strong>.</p><p>Mathematicians assume that axioms are true without being able to prove them. However this is not as problematic as it may seem, because axioms are either <em>definitions</em> or clearly obvious, and there are only very few axioms. For example, an axiom could be that <em>a</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>a</em> for any two numbers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p><p>Axioms are important to get right, because all of mathematics rests on them. If there are too few axioms, you can prove very little and mathematics would not be very interesting. If there are too many axioms, you can prove almost anything, and mathematics would also not be interesting. You also can&#8217;t have axioms contradicting each other.</p><p>Mathematics is not about choosing the right set of axioms, but about developing a framework from these starting points. If you start with different axioms, you will get a <em>different kind of mathematics</em>, but the logical arguments will be the same. Every area of mathematics has its own set of basic axioms.</p><p>When mathematicians have proven a theorem, they publish it for other mathematicians to check. Sometimes they find a mistake in the logical argument, and sometimes a mistake is not found until many years later. However, in principle, it is always possible to break a proof down into the basic axioms.</p><h2>Set Theory and the Axiom of Choice</h2><div class="rbox"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/sets.png" width="270" height="180"/></div><p>To formulate proofs it is sometimes necessary to go back to the very foundation of the language in which mathematics is written: set theory.</p><p>A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of objects, such a numbers. The elements of a set are usually written in curly brackets. We can find the <strong>union</strong> of two sets (the set of elements which are in <em>either</em> set) or we can find the <strong>intersection</strong> of two sets (the set of elements which are in <em>both</em> sets).</p><p>Many mathematical problems can be formulated in the language of set theory, and to prove them we need set theory axioms. Over time, mathematicians have used various different collections of axioms, the most widely accepted being nine <strong>Zermelo-Fraenkel</strong> (ZF) axioms:</p><div class="flexBoxWrap" style="margin-bottom: 3.15%"><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom1.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">AXIOM OF EXTENSION</span><br><span class="dgrey">If two sets have the same elements, then they are equal.</span></p></div><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom2.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">AXIOM OF SEPERATION</span><br><span class="dgrey">We can form a subset of a set, which consists of some elements.</span></p></div><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom3.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">EMPTY SET AXIOM</span><br><span class="dgrey">There is a set with no members, written as {} or &empty;.</span></p></div></div><div class="flexBoxWrap" style="margin: 3.15% auto"><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom4.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">PAIR-SET AXIOM</span><br><span class="dgrey">Given two objects <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> we can form a set {<em>x</em>, y}.</span></p></div><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom5.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">UNION AXIOM</span><br><span class="dgrey">We can form the union of two or more sets.</span></p></div><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom6.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">POWER SET AXIOM</span><br><span class="dgrey">Given any set, we can form the set of all subsets (the power set).</span></p></div></div><div class="flexBoxWrap" style="margin-top: 3.15%"><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom7.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">AXIOM OF INFINITY</span><br><span class="dgrey">There is a set with infinitely many elements.</span></p></div><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom8.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">AXIOM OF FOUNDATION</span><br><span class="dgrey">Sets are built up from simpler sets, meaning that every (non-empty) set has a minimal member.</span></p></div><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom9.png" width="150" height="80" alt=""><p><span class="red">AXIOM OF REPLACEMENT</span><br><span class="dgrey">If we apply a function to every element in a set, the answer is still a set.</span></p></div></div><p>If you think about set theory, most of these axioms will seem completely obvious &#8211; and this is what axioms are supposed to be. However there is a tenth axiom which is rather more problematic:</p><div class="frame sansSerif flexBox1" style="width: 320px; max-width: 90%; margin: 1.5em auto"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/axiom10.png" width="200" height="90" alt=""><p><span class="red">AXIOM OF CHOICE</span><br><span class="dgrey">Given infinitely many non-empty sets, you can choose one element from each of these sets.</span></p></div><p>On first sight, the Axiom of Choice (AC) looks just as innocent as the others above. However the use of <em>infinity</em> has a number of unexpected consequences. For example, you can use AC to prove that it is possible to cut a sphere into five pieces and reassemble them to make <em>two</em> spheres, each identical to the initial sphere. This is only a theoretical concept &#8211; the required cuts are <a href="Fractals.html">fractal</a>, which means they can&#8217;t actually exist in real life, and some of the pieces are &#8220;non-measurable&#8221; which means that they don&#8217;t have a volume defined. But the fact that the Axiom of Choice can be used to construct these impossible cuts is quite concerning.</p><p>There is a passionate debate among logicians, whether to accept the axiom of choice or not. Every collection of axioms forms a small &#8220;mathematical world&#8221;, and different theorems may be true in different worlds. It is really just a question of whether you are happy to live in a world where you can make two spheres from one&hellip;</p><h2>Proof by Induction</h2><p><strong>Proof by Induction</strong> is a technique which can be used to prove that a certain statement is true for all natural numbers 1, 2, 3, &hellip; The &#8220;statement&#8221; is usually an equation or formula which includes a variable <em>n</em> which could be any natural number. Let us denote the statement applied to <em>n</em> by S(<em>n</em>). Here are the four steps of mathematical induction:</p><ul><li>First we prove that S(1) is true, i.e. that the statement S is true for 1.</li><li>Now we assume that S(<em>k</em>) is true, i.e. that the statement S is true for some natural number <em>k</em>.</li><li>Using this assumption, we try to deduce that S(<em>k</em> + 1) is also true. Thus whenever S is true for one number it is also true for the next number.</li><li>Since we know S(1) is true, S(2) must be true. And therefore S(3) must be true. And therefore S(4) must be true. And so on: S must be true for all numbers.</li></ul><div class="rbox" style="margin-right: -5.5%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; max-width: 60%"><img src="resources/Axioms_and_Proof/dominoes.jpg" width="360" height="207"/></div><p>Induction can be compared to falling dominoes: whenever one domino falls, the next one also falls. The first step, proving that S(1) is true, starts the infinite chain reaction.</p><p class="lgrey">The first step, because so easy, is often overlooked.

This included proving all theorems using a set of simple and universal axioms, proving that this set of axioms is <em>consistent</em>, and proving that this set of axioms is <em>complete</em>, i.e. that <em>any</em> mathematical statement can be proved or disproved using the axioms.</p><p>Unfortunately, these plans were destroyed by Kurt G&ouml;del in 1931. He proved than in any <span class="lgrey">(sufficiently complex)</span> mathematical system with a certain set of axioms, you can find some statements which can neither be proved nor disproved using those axioms. It is also not possible to prove that a certain set of axioms is consistent, using nothing but the axioms itself.</p><p>G&ouml;del&rsquo;s discovery is based on the fact that a set of axioms can&rsquo;t be used to say anything <em>about itself</em>, such as whether it is consistent. Problems with self-reference can not only be found in mathematics but also in language. Here is the <strong>Liar Paradox</strong>:</p><p class="centre i">&#8220;This sentence is false.&#8221;</p><p>The sentence above tries to say something about itself. If it is true then the sentence tells us that it is false. If it is false, then the sentence tells us that it is not false, i.e. that it is true. In effect, the sentence is neither true nor false.</p><p>When first published, G&ouml;del&rsquo;s theorems were deeply troubling to many mathematicians. When setting out to prove an observation, you don&#8217;t know whether a proof exists &#8211; the result might be true but <em>unprovable</em>. Today we know that incompleteness is a fundamental part of not only logic but also computer science, which relies on machines performing logical operations.</p><p>Surprisingly, it <em>is</em> possible to prove that certain statements are unprovable. One example is the <a href="Infinity">Continuum Hypothesis</a>, which is about the size of infinite sets.</p><p>Towards the end of his life, Kurt G&ouml;del developed severe mental problems and he died of self-starvation in 1978. His insights into the foundations of logic were the most profound ones since the development of proof by the ancient Greeks.</p></div></div><div class="bottomBar"></div></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="scripts/jquery-203.js"><\/script>')</script><script src="/scripts/layout.min.js?v=4"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js"></script><script>window.ga = window.ga || function() { (ga.q = ga.q||[]).push(arguments) }; ga.l = 1 * new Date();
